How Google uses NLP?

It uses Bert in 10% of it's searches (https://searchengineland.com/faq-all-about-the-bert-algorithm-in-google-search-324193). Introducing is considered "single biggest ... most positive change they've made in the last five years and perhaps one of the biggest since the beginning" to search, according to Pandu Nayak, VP of search (https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931657/google-bert-search-context-algorithm-change-10-percent-langauge). Before search queries where treated as bag of words!

Additionally, a lot of work has been done in Machine Translation. Google publishes a lot of papers in this area and that is not suprise, since they have great Google Translate product. It is very useful to translate webpages and at this point it works good enough to translate english webpages to polish, so that I can show my dad some articles to read and discuss. Google started using GNMT (Google neural machine translation) in November 2016. Since then it probably improved
a lot when transformers and then Bert were introduced.
