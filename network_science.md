Barabasi's book "Network Science"

Motivation and his personal journey to coming up with Barabasi-Alberta model:

""Hawoong’s data was a shocking departure from everything I learned during my four year journey into networks. There was no trace in the literature of a network with a power law degree distribution. In fact, no one seemed to care much about the degree distribution up to that point: Both the random graph and the social network literature took the Poisson form for granted. The power law observed by us predicted that the Web has hubs, nodes with a huge number of links, outliers forbidden in a
random universe. None of the existing models could account for them."

"If networks as different as the Web and Hollywood display the same power-law degree distribution, then the property we saw earlier on the WWW is universal! Hence some common law or mechanism must be responsible for its emergence! And if it applies to systems as different as actors, a computer chip or the Web, the explanation needs to be fundamental and simple."

He also notices the importance of framing a research problem (which to me seems kind of close to marketing or selling):

* "When the Watts and Strogatz paper about small world networks was published in Nature in 1998 [8], it first brought back memories of my failed attempt to publish my second network paper in the same journal three years earlier. The roots of my failure became painfully obvious as I read their paper: I had a massive framing problem. Both papers used the random network paradigm. Yet, I asked questions of interest to physicists, while directing the paper to neuroscientists. In contrast, the questions asked by Duncan and Steve were deeply rooted in sociology, six degrees offering a brilliant narrative for their manuscript.

And he decided to use this observations to his success and talks about it honestly:

"It was tempting to focus on the true discovery, which was simple: the WWW represents a new type of network, a previously unrecognized form of organization. I sensed, however, that this would be a mistake. By then I was convinced that the failure of my second network paper had little to do with its science, but was a framing problem. Focusing on the inherent, scientific value of the observation was too dry, unlikely to excite the editors of Nature. So I decided to use a Trojan horse instead: I hid the discovery under six degrees. We entitled the paper the Diameter of the World Wide Web, and trumped up the fact that six is really nineteen on the Web, and mailed it off it to Nature [9]."

It is interesting how quickly he wrote the research papers once he came up with the idea: "There is an expectation in the physics community that short publications, like a Nature, Science or a Physical Review Letters paper, should be followed by a “long paper,” offering a detailed exposition of the results. So in those seven days Réka, Hawoong and I wrote the long paper as well."

Author emphasises the importance of failures (years of seemingly fruitless work) and collaboration (he wouldn't achieve anything without his coworkers).
